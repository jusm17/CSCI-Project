<p> My favorite book is Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. The novel tells the story of a dystopian United States in which the economy is increasingly regulated by laws. Titans of industry who believe in honest trade began to disappear and the world begins to crumble as these titans began to leave. The book teaches the importance of reason, individualism and maintaining capitalism. It explains “the role of man’s mind in existence.” </p>
<p>Both <i>East of Eden</i> and <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> are classic American novels that have been praised for their ability to effect every generation that has read them.
